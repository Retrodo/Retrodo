Hello to anyone reading, I'm @Retrodo!

Currently I work as an IT Support Senior Tech, but I've been looking to learn 
and expand my horizons through programming, certifications, and general experience.

Programming is a hobby of mine that I only touch when I get the chance. 
Most work I have done has been PowerShell scripting for automation around my workplace.
